	abstract = {This paper surveys the recent attempts, both from the machine learning and operations research communities, at leveraging machine learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Given the hard nature of these problems, state-of-the-art algorithms rely on handcrafted heuristics for making decisions that are otherwise too expensive to compute or mathematically not well defined. Thus, machine learning looks like a natural candidate to make such decisions in a more principled and optimized way. We advocate for pushing further the integration of machine learning and combinatorial optimization and detail a methodology to do so. A main point of the paper is seeing generic optimization problems as data points and inquiring what is the relevant distribution of problems to use for learning on a given task.},

  abstract = {Which is the minimum number of variables that need branching for a given MIP instance? Can this information be effective in producing compact branching trees, hence improving the performance of a state-of-the-art solver? In this paper we present a restart exact MIP solution scheme where a set covering model is used to find a small set of variables (a ``backdoor'', in the terminology of [8]) to be used as first-choice variables for branching. In a preliminary ``sampling'' phase, our method quickly collects a number of relevant low-cost fractional solutions that qualify as obstacles for LP bound improvement. Then a set covering model is solved to detect a small subset of variables (the backdoor) that ``cover the fractionality'' of the collected fractional solutions. These backdoor variables are put in a priority branching list, and a black-box MIP solver is eventually run---in its default mode---by taking this list into account, thus avoiding any other interference with its highly-optimized internal mechanisms. Computational results on a large set of instances from MIPLIB 2010 are presented, showing that some speedup can be achieved even with respect to a state-of-the-art solver such as IBM ILOG Cplex 12.2.},
